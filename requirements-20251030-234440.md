# Requirements - Compliant Private Transfers

**Created**: 2025-10-30 23:44:40  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Status**: Draft

---

## Functional (User Stories)
- As a verified user (ICP II), I can link my wallet to start private transfers.
- As a user, I can generate zk proofs for deposits/withdrawals without mixing semantics.
- As a user, I can request allowlisted relayer service and view fees.
- As compliance, I can request selective disclosure bundles with proofs.

## Non-Functional
- Performance: proof gen < 10s (MVP target); relayer latency < 5s P50
- Security: OWASP ASVS; CSRF where relevant; rate limiting; audit logs
- Availability: static build on IPFS/IPNS; multi-gateway support

## Prioritization (MoSCoW)
- Must: ICP II KYC, screening, EVM shielded flows, relayer allowlist, IPFS/IPNS
- Should: Disclosure bundles, SOL adapter, policy engine
- Could: Analytics dashboards, SDKs
- Won't (MVP): Mixer semantics, custodial custody

## Success Criteria & KPIs
