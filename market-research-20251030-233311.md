**Status**: Research Draft

## Executive Summary
There is sustained demand for privacy in transfers, but adoption hinges on KYC/AML, auditability, and policy controls. A compliance-first, zk-based approach without mixer semantics addresses institutional requirements while serving advanced retail in regulated markets.

---

## Market Overview
- Demand: Private transfers with regulatory compliance for institutions and advanced retail.
- Constraint: KYC and auditability requirements in major jurisdictions.

---

## TAM/SAM/SOM (Directional)
- TAM: Global crypto transfer market with privacy needs (institutions + prosumers).
- SAM: Regulated jurisdictions requiring KYC/privacy.
- SOM: Early adopters on EVM; expand to SOL/BNB/TRX post-MVP.

---

## Segmentation & Personas
- Institutions (exchanges, funds), OTC desks, advanced retail in compliant regions.
- Personas: compliance officer, treasury ops, advanced retail (aligned with strategy).

---

## Competitive Landscape
- Mixers: non-compliant → out of scope.
- L2 privacy rollups: strong tech, unclear compliance.
- Custodial privacy: compliant but centralized trust/custody risk.

---

## Regulatory & Compliance Landscape
- Requirements: KYC/AML, OFAC screening, auditable disclosures, policy controls.
- Design: ICP Internet Identity (KYC), allowlisted relayers, selective disclosure, no source-obfuscation.

---

## User Research & JTBD
- JTBD: “Move funds privately across chains and disclose to auditors when required.”
- Pain points: balance/counterparty exposure; screening failures; operational overhead.

---

## Key Insights
- Compliance-first privacy unlocks institutional adoption.
- No mixer semantics reduces regulatory risk.
- IPFS/IPNS hosting reduces infra cost and increases resilience.

---

## Risks & Mitigations
- Regulatory change → configurable policy engine.
- Relayer availability → multi-relayer allowlist + staking.
- Cross-chain complexity → phased adapters with EVM-first.
